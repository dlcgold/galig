Finished job 2.

rule extractAnnotation:
    input: data/annotation.gtf
    output: data/annotation21.gtf
    jobid: 1

Error in rule extractAnnotation:
    jobid: 1
    output: data/annotation21.gtf
    shell:
        
        grep -P "^21\t" data/annotation.gtf > data/annotation21.gtf
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job extractAnnotation since they might be corrupted:
data/annotation21.gtf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
