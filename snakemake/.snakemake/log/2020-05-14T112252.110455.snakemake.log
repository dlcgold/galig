Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 72 of /home/dlcgold/stage-unimib/extra/snake/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/annotationsLessExon
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job removeExon since they might be corrupted:
data/annotationsLessExon.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
