ImproperOutputException in line 58 of /home/dlcgold/stage-unimib/extra/snake/Snakefile:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule splitAnnotation:
data/annotations
Removing output files of failed job splitAnnotation since they might be corrupted:
data/annotations.txt, data/annotations
Skipped removing non-empty directory data/annotations
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
